# UAV flight data anomaly detection based on oversampling projection approximation basis pursuit
# Aiming at the low accuracy problem of flight data online anomaly detection caused by flight mode switching of UAV, 
# an online anomaly detection method is proposed based on OverSampling Projection Approximation Basis Pursuit (OSPABP)
